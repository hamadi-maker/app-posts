# 📜 Project Title: **Next.js Blog Viewer**

## Description:
This is my first Next.js application that fetches and displays posts from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). The app allows users to browse all posts and view the details of a selected post.

## Features:
- 📰 **Fetch and display all posts** from the JSONPlaceholder API
- 🔍 **View detailed information** by selecting a specific post
- 🚀 **Built with Next.js** for fast, server-side rendering

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **Backend API**: JSONPlaceholder (Mock API)

## Why This Project?
I built this project to learn and practice **Next.js**, focusing on:
- API integration
- Dynamic routing
